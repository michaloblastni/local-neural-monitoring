# Local Neural Monitoring 0.2.0

**Local Neural Monitoring** is a simple Windows application that monitors and records your neural activity at home. It works with the [Olimex EEG-SMT device](https://www.olimex.com/Products/EEG/OpenEEG/EEG-SMT/open-source-hardware), which you plug into your computer with a USB cable. The application shows two channels with your neural activity, allows you to filter the alpha waves, beta waves, and other. You can also record your neural activity with it and later analyze it using Jupyter notebook to investigate something that you want to know.

## 🧭 How to start (even if you're not a developer)

1. Download the .exe from the latest release
2. Plug the device into a USB port
3. Run the application and you will see your EEG waveform updated in real time
4. See Help → Contents to learn the basics
6. Filter brainwave type using the Band menu if you want to investigate some specific neural activity
7. Press File → Start recording / stop recording if you want to record your neural activity into a file

Once you become proficient by reading the Help and experimenting with the device, you can use it also with more advanced software such as Electric Guru, OpenViBE, BrainBay.

## 📂 File Overview for developers
- `Makefile` - Makefile for MINGW
- `local_neural_monitoring.c` – Core application code (UI, serial I/O, band filtering, plotting)
- `serial.c` - stopping serial
- `recording.c` - EEG data recording (CSV file format)
- `help.chm` *(optional)* – Local help file, opened from the Help menu
